The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern used to enable two incompatible
interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two objects, allowing a class to
interface with another class that otherwise would be incompatible due to different
interfaces. The Adapter pattern wraps an existing class with a new interface to make it
compatible with a client's expectations.

Key Components:
Target Interface: The interface that the client expects or interacts with.
Adaptee: The existing class with an incompatible interface that needs adaptation.
Adapter: A class that implements the target interface and adapts the behavior of the
         Adaptee to the expected Target interface.
Client: The entity that interacts with the Target interface through the Adapter.

Example:
Let's say we have a MediaPlayer interface that plays audio files.
We also have an AdvancedMediaPlayer that can play additional
formats like VLC and MP4. The Adapter will allow the MediaPlayer
to use the AdvancedMediaPlayer without changing its interface.
